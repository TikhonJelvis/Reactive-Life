# A Reactive Game of Life

This is an interactive implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life][1], used as a demo to explain (simple) functional reactive programming (FRP). It was written for my talk on the subject at the East Bay Haskell meetup in Berkeley.

The interface is written using the `threepenny-gui` library which uses a web browser as a display. It works by running a webserver locally and sending commands to a simple client running in JavaScript. It's easy to setup and doesn't require any tricky dependencies.

As a nice bonus to this particular approach, it comes with an FRP library built in (heavily based on `reactive-banana`â€”both are by the same author).
